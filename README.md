# Memory-Analyser
Memory-Analyser is an electronic game which checks your concentration 

I have tried making it using HTML , CSS and Javascript ( also used jQuery as framework. )

How to Play?

1. Press any key on the keyboard to start playing the game.
2. The game played on alternating turns between computer and the player (user).
3. At first the computer turns first and selects one of the four tiles(namely, blue, red, yellow and green).
4. After, that player has to choose the right order in which computer selects the turns (in such a way that user need to start selecting all the tiles from the beginning).
5. At every level one new tile will be selected by the computer which player needs to remeber to pass the current level and to reach to the next level.
6. If at any step , the player couldn't selects the right order then, the game gets over.
7. If they want to play again, they need to press any key on the keyboard.(and the game will start again)
